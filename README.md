# VBA-Challenge

Some of the code was other assignments and questioning ChatGPT.  I learned how to troubleshoot. I kept changing the code as I thought I was understanding it.  
First step was learning how to isolate and run the code on a single worksheet.
On the one worksheet, I created a summary section so that the stock symbol (tickername) can be summarized.
I added two additional columns so I could verify the open price from the beginning of the year to the close price at the end of the year.
I had an issue and contacted BCS and the code was changed again causing a delay but determined to get it uploaded.
