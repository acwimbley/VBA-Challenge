# VBA-Challenge

There are three modules containing the following scripts for testing and completing challenge
Module 1 - creates a summary sheet (idea from one of the class assignments) and all stock information from the individual worksheets are combined in that one summary sheet.
Module 2 - tests the scripts in summarizing each ticker symbol.  I added the open and close price column so that I can check if the script was pulling the information correctly for calculation
Module 3 - this one tests that what can be done on one worksheet was able to be done on all worksheets in the workbook

My current challenge was the conditional formatting which I could not get to work so I removed and the Calculated values
