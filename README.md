# VBA-Challenge

There are five modules containing the following scripts for testing and completing challenge
Module 1 - creates a summary sheet (idea from one of the class assignments) and all stock information from the individual worksheets are combined in that one summary sheet.
Module 2 - tests the scripts in summarizing each ticker symbol.  I added the open and close price column so that I can check if the script was pulling the information correctly for calculation
Module 3 - This was my first script in testing the script on one worksheet to verify that it worked before testing on the entire workbook
Module 4 - Added the conditional formatting script - this one was created with the help of ChatGPT
Module 5 - Added the metrics - this one was created with the help of ChatGPT
